0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
#AUTHOR: ANIFRED THOMAS
In this project I learnt the following;
four different sorting algorithms at least,
What the Big O notation is,
and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What a stable sorting algorithm is.
